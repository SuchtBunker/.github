# SuchtBunker

We will release most of our source-code (mainly DarkRP) here bit by bit.\
We can't just publish everything instantly because some parts of the code need major refactoring to work on a default, unmodified server and without major manual configuration. 
Maybe someone will find something here useful.

## Help
Basic knowlegde how to install addons is a basic requirement to use our addons.\
You should be able to read the readme.md files within the addons to figure everything out yourself.\
Configuration is normally done in *addon-name*/lua/autorun/*addon-name*.lua\
If not, you may ask within an issue on the specific addon.

## Bugs
If you find any issues/bugs with our addons you may create an issue in the addons repository.\
Maybe we'll take a look.

## Language
All of our addons are written in German. If you need any other language and have some spare time, feel free to add some kind of localization functionality to our addons.
